Module 3 — Feasibility & Guardrails

Apply these if/else checks to keep plans realistic and adaptive:
	1.	Closed Venue
	•	If a museum or park is closed on that day → suggest a similar indoor option nearby.
	2.	Over-Budget Meal
	•	If a restaurant cost exceeds the user’s budget → switch to a cheaper similar cuisine.
	3.	Too Far or Long Travel
	•	If travel time between activities is more than 25 minutes or more than 5 km → pick a closer alternative or add a short transit hop.
	4.	Weather Swap
	•	If heavy rain or very cold weather is expected → swap at least one outdoor activity for a nearby indoor alternative.
	Change Log (2025-11-18): – Updated distance rule to support ‘short walks only’ preference.
	5.	Time Overrun 
	•	If the total planned time exceeds available hours → shorten lunch or choose a closer activity.
	6.	Mobility Needs
	•	If mobility constraints exist → pick step-free, short-walk options and include rest breaks.
	7.	Dietary Needs
	•	If the user is vegan or has dietary restrictions → ensure all meals match or replace with compliant options.
	8.	Bookings
	•	If an activity usually requires tickets → remind the user to book (never simulate the booking).
