Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days) 

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).
Each activity should include type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build each day:
	•	Morning: choose an activity near lodging
	•	Midday: pick a nearby attraction or food stop
	•	Afternoon: choose something with a different theme
	•	Evening: select a restaurant or optional event

This module organizes the trip into a clear morning → midday → afternoon → evening structure.
